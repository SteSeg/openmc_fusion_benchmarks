# openmc_sinbad_benchmarks

## Installation
```
pip install .
```

## Folder organization
The `src` folder provides all the classes and functions of the package. It also has additional data in the `data` subfolder (e.g. IRDFF-2 cross sections) and some neutron source characteristics, importable as `openmc.Source` object, in the `neutron_sources` subfolder (so far there is only the Frascati Neutron Generator - FNG energy and angular characteristics).

The `notebooks` folder contains some useful tutorial notebooks.

The `models` folder has all the models and benchmarks covered by this repo (e.g. the `fng-str` and `fns-duct` benchmarks). Each bechmark provides an `openmc_model.py` file that has the Python API input file for the relative openmc model. It can be run via command line and often has some different options for running it. There should be also a `postprocessing.ipynb` jupyter notebook for quick result visualization and confrontation against other experimental or other codes' results. 

## Interactive database
Each model has a `results_database` subfolder that contains the experimental results as well as previous simulation results of the benchmark in form of hdf files. Tutorial notebooks in the `notebooks` folder show how to navigate those files. All the hdf files belonging to the same model should have same structure (same tallies, with the same name, postprocessed in the same way and extractable in the same way). Each `results_database` subfolder should have at least an `experiment.h5` file. Results from openmc and other codes are more than welcome, especially if built consistently with the files already present.

## Contribute
The contribution workflow is semi-automated for the openmc code. Users can run any openmc model and then the postprocessing notebook for a direct validation of the openmc version they use but they can also contribute to the repository. It is sufficient to:
- Run an openmc model (with sufficient number of particles)
- Postprocess them (see `read_openmc_statepoints.ipynb` notebook)
- Push results to the `results_database` folder relative to the tested model provide as many info as possible (i.e. code version, nuclear data library, number of particles run etc. - see `push_openmc_to_database.ipynb` notebook)
